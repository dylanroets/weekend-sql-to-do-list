# Project Name
Dylan's To Do List

## Description

_Duration:  Weekend Challenge Week 8 Fri-Sun @ 6pm


I developed a full stack web application to handle anyone's personal "To Do List". The goal was to make a reliable database where your chores will be saved, updated and even deleted upon completion. Also made sure to have the ability to check tasks that are completed in order to wait deletion. Or if you delete one on accident you can quickly add another task at the top and submit it. Added some dynamic colors to indicate when an item is checked as well with color schemes that are distinct and readable.

### Prerequisites

Link to software that is required to install the app (e.g. node).

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Express
- JQuery 
- Postico 2

## Installation

How do you get your application up and running? This is a step by step list for how another developer could get this project up and running. The good target audience in terms of knowledge, would be a fellow Primer from another cohort being able to spin up this project. Note that you do not need a paragraph here to intro Installation. It should be step-by-step.

If your application has secret keys (for example --  Twilio), make sure you tell them how to set that up, both in getting the key and then what to call it in the `.env` file.

1. Create a database named `your database name`,
2. The queries in the `database.sql` file are set up to create all the necessary tables and populate the needed data to allow the application to run correctly. The project is built on [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/download/), so you will need to make sure to have that installed. We recommend using Postico to run those queries as that was used to create the queries, 
3. Open up your editor of choice and run an `npm install`
4. Run `npm install pg` in your terminal to set up pool
5. Run `npm start` in your terminal to start server, should listen on 5000

## Usage
How does someone use this application? Tell a user story here.

1. Use preloaded tasks in the database to keep track of To Do's
2. Add tasks that need completing at the top input field
3. Mark Tasks complete as you finish them
4. Delete them as you see fit
5. Delete's are permanent but you can always add another task


## Built With

- Javascript
- JQuery
- Node
- Postico 2
- PostgresSQL
